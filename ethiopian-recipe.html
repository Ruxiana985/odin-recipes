    <h1>Recipe list for the flavorful ethiopian cuisine</h1>
    <p>Ethiopian cuisine is a flavorful journey through history. With ancient roots tracing back over 3,000 years to the Aksumite Empire, 
        it’s built on teff, a tiny grain used to make injera, a spongy flatbread that’s a staple of every meal. <br> The cuisine features berbere, 
        a spicy blend of chili peppers, garlic, and other spices, which adds a unique kick to dishes. 
        Religious practices also shape the cuisine, leading to a rich variety of vegetarian dishes.<br>
         Ethiopian food is a vibrant mix of tradition, flavor, and communal dining.</p>

    <a id="misir"> <strong>Misir Recipe</strong></a>
    <li>INGREDIENTS</li>
      <ul>
        <li> 2 cup red lentils, rinsed and drained </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spiced butter) or regular butter</li>
        <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger, minced</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons berbere spice mix (Ethiopian chili spice blend)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 cups water </li>
        <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro </li>
      </ul>
    <li>STEPS</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Niter Kibbeh is a spiced clarified butter. To make it, melt unsalted butter in a saucepan, add spices like cardamom, cinnamon, garlic, and ginger, and simmer on low until the butter is infused with flavors. Strain the spices and set the clarified butter aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the niter kibbeh or butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until they are deeply caramelized and golden brown, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic and ginger and cook for another 2-3 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the berbere spice blend to the pot and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. This step is crucial to bloom the spices and enhance their flavor. Be careful not to burn them.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another 2 minutes to deepen the flavor.
          Add the rinsed lentils to the pot and mix well to coat them with the spices.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water or vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer uncovered for about 20-25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender and the stew has thickened. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li> Add salt and black pepper to taste. If the stew is too thick, add a little more water or broth to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt as needed. Garnish with fresh cilantro if desired. Serve with injera (Ethiopian flatbread)</li>
      </ol>





      <a id="shiro"> <strong>Shiro Recipe</strong></a>
    <li>INGREDIENTS</li>
      <ul>
        <li> 1 cup shiro powder (available at Ethiopian or international grocery stores) </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spiced butter) or regular butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons berbere spice mix (adjust based on spice preference)</li>
        <li>1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 cups vegetable broth or water</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro (optional, for garnish)</li>
      </ul>
    <li>STEPS</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the niter kibbeh or butter in a pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until they are golden brown and caramelized, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic and ginger and cook for another 2-3 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Mix in the berbere spice, cooking for 1-2 minutes to release the flavors.</li>
        <li>Stir in the diced tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes, allowing the mixture to thicken</li>
        <li>Gradually stir in the shiro powder, mixing well to avoid lumps. Cook for 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to combine.</li>
        <li> Slowly add the vegetable broth or water, stirring continuously to achieve a smooth consistency. Bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The shiro should thicken to a stew-like consistency. Adjust the thickness by adding more liquid if needed.</li>
        <li>Finally,serve it with injera and a little tip from me for killing fragrance and taste, add melted butter in your serving bowl</li>
      </ol>
