   <h1>Satay Chicken Skewers recipe </h1>
   <p>Picture this: early 19th-century Java, where street vendors had a brilliant idea—skewer marinated meat, grill it over charcoal, and serve it with a punchy peanut sauce.
     This genius move combined local spices with foreign kebab traditions, creating satay chicken skewers. 
    The peanut sauce—creamy, spicy, and irresistible—became the star. 
    <br>Satay spread across Southeast Asia, each region adding its twist, before conquering global menus. 
    So, when you enjoy a satay skewer, you're savoring a delicious piece of culinary history from Javanese street vendors to your plate.</p>
